# Sinatra-Steam-App

This Sinatra web app will help you keep track of your consoles and games that you own.

* Console (Company and Model)
* Game (Title and Genre)

## Usage

Clone this repo, then run `bundle install`, `rake db:migrate` and then run `shotgun`.

## Functionality

Create your login, and then add away!
Each user is private, meaning there is no way any other user can see what is stored under your account.
Everything is fairly obvious from signing in. Create a console, then add your games!
